# Generative Data Augmentation Demo

Main GitHub Repo: [Generative Data Augmentation](https://github.com/zhulinchng/generative-data-augmentation) | Image Classification Demo: [Generative Augmented Classifiers](https://huggingface.co/spaces/czl/generative-augmented-classifiers).

This demo is created as part of the 'Investigating the Effectiveness of Generative Diffusion Models in Synthesizing Images for Data Augmentation in Image Classification' dissertation.

The user can augment an image by interpolating between two prompts, and specify the number of interpolation steps and the specific step to generate the image.

## Demo Usage Instructions

1. Upload an image.
2. Enter the two prompts to interpolate between, the first prompt should contain the desired class of the augmented image, the second prompt should contain the undesired class (i.e., confusing class).

## Configuration

- Total Interpolation Steps: The number of steps to interpolate between the two prompts.
- Interpolation Step: The specific step to generate the image.
- Example for 10 steps:

    ```python
        Total:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
        Sampled:          4
    ```

- Seed: Seed value for reproducibility.
- Negative Prompt: Prompt to guide the model away from generating the image.
- Width, Height: The dimensions of the generated image.
- Guidance Scale: The scale of the guide the model on how closely to follow the prompts.

## Metadata

[SSIM Score](https://lightning.ai/docs/torchmetrics/stable/image/structural_similarity.html): Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) score between the original and generated image, ranges from 0 to 1.
[CLIP Score](https://lightning.ai/docs/torchmetrics/stable/multimodal/clip_score.html): CLIP similarity score between the original and generated image, ranges from 0 to 100.
